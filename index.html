				<h3>About Me</h3>
				<p>
					I'm a web developer based in lively New York City. This is
					my personal website where I showcase some of the applications
					I've worked on.
				</p>
				<p>
					I got into programming and development during my
					freshmen year of college while participating in a couple of
					competitons. I decided to attend the Flatiron School's Web
					Development Fellowship. The Flatiron School taught me more
					than just how to code. I got better at public speaking, studying,
					and having the correct mentality needed to continue learning more.
				</p>
				<p>
					Along with HTML5/CSS3, I have experience working with front-end frameworks including Angular and React.
					I am currently focusing more on React and Redux, and learning Python on the side to fulfill my
					eventual goal of getting into machine learning.
				</p>

					<!-- Welcome to my personal website, where I tell you
					a bit about myself and showcase my past work. I am a
					web developer based in New York City. I became interested in
					programming when I attended the Flatiron School's Web Development
					Fellowship. I interned at Risk Management Solutions (RMS), where I learned
					AngularJS. I worked on a couple of projects to become better with Angular
					and front-end development. Built NYC Status, Trek, etc. I started my
					internship at Ralph Interactive. I learned React and Redux there, and instantly
					switched over from Angular. Love React. -->
